  <h1>A Brief History of Nightfall Clan</h1>

  <h2>The Outset <span class="c-year-range">(2010–2011)</span></h2>
  <p>
    <b>Nightfall Clan (NFC)</b> was founded on March 6, 2010 by
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/users/785045/profile">Soccerpr89</a>,
    who at the time was an infamous ex-HR of the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/groups/18">United Clan of ROBLOX (UCR)</a>.
    NFC gained members at a steady pace and reached 1,000 total members with
    impressive speed.
    <br><br>
    Soccer gave up responsibility of the group very early on.
    Before long though there was a struggle for power between Vince13579 and
    Soccer that also involved
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/users/648020/profile">trick555</a>
    and dboot98. This first major conflict
    lasted a little over two weeks and eventually resulted in Soccer allowing
    Vince to maintain ownership of the group for the time being.
    <br><br>
    Over the next few months, Vince grew NFC even more by spending money
    earned from his game on ads. Eventually though Soccer demanded ownership
    of the group be returned to him. Vince complied. Less than three months
    passed before Soccer transferred the group to his sister, 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/users/7714875/profile">buildXbuild</a>,
    for safekeeping.
    <br><br>
    Notable members of buildXbuild's Council were 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/users/9365056/profile">Darxia</a>,
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/users/513328/profile">catlord5</a>,
    and
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/users/88373/profile">b3njam1n</a>,
    who did much of the work in maintaining Nightfall Clan while
    Soccer was away and after buildXbuild became inactive. Darxia was even
    named “Acting Chancellor” in early December of 2010, just a couple of weeks
    before Soccerpr89 evidently returned and became owner once again.
    <br><br>
    In the beginning of 2011, under Soccer's leadership for the third time,
    the group began to stagnate. This continued until March when Soccer once
    again renounced ownership of NFC, giving the clan to Darxia (on the
    condition that it eventually be returned) after being convinced not to
    sell it.
  </p>

  <h2>A New Beginning <span class="c-year-range">(2011)</span></h2>
  <p>
    Many veterans who knew Darxia's era praise it as one of the best for NFC
    and many new and exciting changes were made during this time. NFC began
    to grow once again at a remarkable rate. However, Soccer once again returned
    and sought ownership of the clan. Darxia was unwilling to uphold his promise
    so Soccer made an offer to buy the clan from him. Although Darxia accepted
    the offer and took the Robux he did not hand over ownership. Soccer was very
    upset Darxia had deceived him twice now, so he created a new rival clan and
    called it
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/groups/314668/Nightfall-Army">Nightfall Army (NFA)</a>.
    Months of war ensued, but NFC was already too established and NFA was defeated.
    <br><br>
    In August of 2011, Darxia was succeeded by
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/users/16601274/profile">XNoBoomX</a>,
    who had previously been acting leader of the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/groups/80738/Urban-Assault-Forces">Urban Assault Forces (UAF)</a>
    and was an otherwise notable presence in the clan world. NoBoom's tenure
    didn't last much longer than a month but despite this it was very active
    and is still famed, unlike other eras of comparable length.
  </p>


  <h2>The Golden Age <span class="c-year-range">(2011–2012)</span></h2>
  <p>
    The time proceeding NoBoom’s departure is largely considered the best and
    most important era of Nightfall Clan’s history. In September of 2011,
    NoBoom appointed
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/users/5821118/profile">Fighters1234</a>
    Chancellor. Fighters grew the clan at an immense pace, amassing over ten
    thousand new members in one year’s time. All throughout this growth spurt
    there was no shortage of activity.
    <br><br>
    In 2012 Fighters took a leave of absence and gave ownership of NFC to
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/users/7626010/profile">Fireantfive</a>
    to lead for the summer. Fire was ambitious but he did not achieve
    the success he hoped to during this time. The clan was considerably less
    active and the losses from the ongoing war with
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/groups/165491/The-Robloxian-Army-TRA">The Robloxian Army (TRA)</a>
    began to pile on, eventually resulting in huge defeat.
    <br><br>
    Fighters returned towards the end of the summer and regained ownership of
    the group. Later that fall Fighters and one of his Vice Chancellors,
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/users/421796/profile">bob104810</a>,
    launched Operation Green Thunder. A plan involving
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/users/13416513/profile">Merely</a>,
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/users/2231221/profile">TheGamer101</a>,
    and others to “strategically invest huge amounts of Robux into Nightfall
    Clan”. Hundreds of thousands of Robux were given to Nightfall Clan and
    the group gained an additional two thousand members in as little as two
    weeks.
  </p>


  <h2>The Downward Spiral <span class="c-year-range">(2012–2013)</span></h2>
  <p>
    In November of 2012 Bob became NFC’s 14th Chancellor. Bob’s activity in
    the clan was relatively low and inconsistent throughout his term. However,
    he maintained a healthy partnership with Fire, now firmly second in
    command, who picked up the slack where needed. For many members of NFC,
    though, this wasn’t enough, and in April of 2013 there was a major
    rebellion among many officers that attempted to deliver an ultimatum
    demanding Bob step down or they would leave the clan. Bob squandered this
    rebellion quickly and many who participated faced demotion or exile.
  </p>

  <h2>Into the Fire <span class="c-year-range">(2013–2014)</span></h2>
  <p>
    To the satisfaction of much of NFC, Fireantfive became Chancellor in June
    of 2013. Fire was an eager and theatrical leader; utilizing speeches,
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7fZoPROmUxY5ig5tCMqe0w">videos</a>,
    and other forms of propaganda heavily during his second Chancellorship.
    Towards the beginning of this era NFC continued down a slow decline in
    activity that began in Bob’s era. In an attempt to reverse this trend
    Fire began making drastic changes, including adopting a WWII-inspired
    motif. This transformation was controversial and Fire struggled to make it
    work for the clan.
    <br><br>
    Eventually Fire abandoned many of his original ideas in the pursuit of
    compromise. A great new effort was made to revitalize NFC, and this
    endeavor was notably more successful. Eventually there was a war with
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/groups/372807/The-Grand-Imperium">The Grand Imperium (TGI)</a>
    that brought even more activity, though it ended in a loss. The next big
    war was with
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/groups/131688/The-Vaktovian-Empire">The Vaktovian Empire (VAK)</a>,
    and NFC was much more prepared this time. To the surprise of many, NFC was
    able to stand toe to toe with VAK for most of the war, trading raid wins on
    several occasions. But in the end NFC couldn’t match the endurance of VAK, and
    once again suffered defeat.
  </p>

  <h2>Renewed Hope <span class="c-year-range">(2014–2015)</span></h2>
  <p>
    After the VAK war had ended Fire resigned and passed down the group to
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/users/64404/profile">BelmontLegend255</a>.
    The clan remained very active under Belmont and he was well liked. Belmont
    sought to improve the internal structures present in Nightfall Clan and took
    care to assemble a good high command. Many wars were won during this time,
    most famously the landmark victory against
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/groups/199219/Vortex-Security">Vortex Security (VS)</a>
    in December, 2014.
    <br><br>
    On December 31st, less than 5 months after Fire’s retirement, Belmont
    announced his relatively sudden retirement and promptly transferred ownership
    of the group over to Council member
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/users/40544/profile">AustinLink</a>.
    Austin was admittedly unprepared for his new role and activity started to
    decline. The following February Austin retired himself and the group went to
    the most active Council member at the time,
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/users/17721897/profile">Ezaiahs</a></span>.
  </p>

  <h2>Ezaiahs <span class="c-year-range">(2015–2017)</span></h2>
  <p>
    Ezaiahs was a very ambitious and driven leader who knew how he wanted to do
    things. Activity was already in sharp decline after Austin’s era and Ezaiahs
    was never able to find a permanent solution despite making many sweeping
    changes during his nearly two year reign. There were many near-rebellions
    during this time as NFC and the clan world at large continued to decline. In
    January of 2017 Council member
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/users/2983178/profile">Thelegender</a>
    led a struggle for power that eventually resulted in Ezaiahs allowing himself
    to be voted out by the other three Council members:
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/users/13085190/profile">WoopiWoopi</a>,
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/users/55383563/profile">rescinded</a>,
    and
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/users/44052422/profile">FrostyShxdows</a>.
    On January 6, 2017 ownership of the group was granted to Thelegender.
    <br><br>
    Thelegender owned the group for only 8 days before very suddenly resigning
    without much of an explanation. The group was given to former second in
    command and long-time NFC advisor
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/users/336003/profile">NoAlias</a>
    (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.roblox.com/users/13912707/profile">WannaBet</a>)
    for holding. An election was then organized to decide who would become acting
    leader. The two primary candidates were Woopi and rescinded. Woopi narrowly
    won the election and NoAlias appointed him Chancellor.
