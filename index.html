However, he maintained a healthy partnership with Fire, now firmly second in command, who picked up the slack where needed. For many members of NFC, though, this wasn&rsquo;t enough, and in April of 2013 there was a major rebellion among many officers that attempted to deliver an ultimatum demanding Bob step down or they would leave the clan.

Towards the beginning of this era NFC continued down a slow decline in activity that began in Bob&rsquo;s era. In an attempt to reverse this trend Fire began making drastic changes, including adopting a WWII-inspired motif. This transformation was controversial and Fire struggled to make it work for the clan.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>Eventually Fire abandoned many of his original ideas in the pursuit of compromise.
